            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my work term report! My name is Andrew Clare-Green, and I am currently a 3rd year student
                majoring in Computer
                Science at
                the
                University of Guelph. This report will highlight my experience working as a Co-op student in the
                Regisrar's Office at the University of Guelph in the Systems and Technologies department. Throughout
                this report I will discuss the accomplishments I have achieved during this work term, the skills I
                developed, and reflect on the goals I set for myself at the start of the term.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="About" class="page">
            <h3>About the Employer</h3>
            <p>The University of Guelph, located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, is home to nearly 30,000 students, offering
                94
                undergraduate degrees, 48 graduate programs, and 6 associate degrees. The university was
                established on
                May 8th, 1964, following the merger of the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC), the Ontario Veterinary
                College, and the
                Macdonald
                Institute. Later that year, Wellington College was added, expanding the university's opportunities in
                arts and sciences.
                <br><br>During my work term, I was employed in the Office of Registrarial Services, which contains a
                variety of departments responsible for student recruitment and admissions, financial support, course and
                exam scheduling, and the production of transcripts and diplomas. I worked within the technological
                department, where I undertook various technical tasks, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and
                further develop my technical skills.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="Goals" class="page">
            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>At the beginning of my work term, I set several goals to achieve by the end of my internship with the
                university. As a computer science major, I am always eager to
                enhance my knowledge and skills in technology. Given the rapidly evolving nature of technology, one of
                my primary goals was to improve my technological literacy by deepening my understanding of both computer
                software and hardware. Additionally, I aimed to expand my skill set by learning and applying a new
                programming language or one with which I had limited experience.<br><br>During my work term, I
                successfully achieved this goal by working with Visual Basic and SQL. I was tasked with reviewing and
                updating code, which required me to use my debugging skills and my ability to comprehend and work with
                existing code. This experience was valuable for my future career, as it provided me with hands on
                experience in Visual Basic and SQL and further developed my problem solving abilities and critical
                thinking skills.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Another goal that I created for myself to acheieve throughout this work term was to improve my written
                communication skills. Strong written communication is essential in ensuring that instructions and
                information are clearly understood, particularly in technical fields. Throughout my work term, I was
                responsible for creating various types of technical documentation, including user guides and internal
                process instructions. It was essential that these documents were not only clear but also precise, as
                they were used many different users. The effectiveness of these documents directly impacted their
                ability to complete tasks accruately. By focusing on structure, clarity, and detail, I ensured that the
                content I created could be easily understood and followed by others which improved overall workflow and
                user experience. This experience significantly contributed to my growth as a student and strengthened my
                ability to translate complex technical concepts into digestable information for a non technical
                audience.

        <div id="Description" class="page">
            <h5>Job Description</h5>
            <p>In this role, I was responsible for a variety of tasks, including software development, hardware
                projects, and supporting technical documentation. I contributed to updating and maintaining several
                technical documents for the university and gained practical experience in editing and debugging Visual
                Basic, SQL, and XML code for forms on the University's website. Additionally, I processed Excel files
                containing information about applicants, transfer students and their academic data, uploading them in a
                test environment to check for errors before uploading in the production database.<br><br>My
                responsibilities also included setting up user accounts, managing security protocols, and
                troubleshooting access issues. This role not only improved my technical literacy but also enhanced my
                communication skills within a professional environment and strengthened my ability to meet tight
                deadlines.</p>

        <div id="Conclusions" class="page">
            <h6>Conclusions</h6>
            <p>Overall, this position provided me with an exceptional work experience and a solid understanding of
                various technologies. I had the opportunity to gain hands on experience by working full-time hours both
                independently and collaboratively with my supervisor.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Acknowledgments" class="page">
            <h7>Acknowledgments</h7>
            <p>I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my supervisor Atyananda Moonilal, for helping me adapt to my
                first technical job, offering assitance whenever necessary, and providing valuable feedback on my
                work.<br><br>I would also like to express my graduate to my Co-op coordinators, Laura Gatto and Kate
                McRoberts, for their support and resources throughout my first Co-op term and for checking in regularly
                during the work term.</p>
