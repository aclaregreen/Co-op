        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Andrew Clare-Green, I am a 3rd year student majoring in Computer Science at
            the
            University of Guelph. This website will highlight my experience working for the University of Guelph in the
            Registrar Office as a Co-op student. This includes what I accomplished during this work term, as well as
            what I
            learned and reflection on my goals I created throughout my term.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="About" class="page">
        <h3>About the Employer</h3>
        <p>Located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, the University of Guelph is home to nearly 30,000 students, offering 94
            undergraduate degrees, 48 graduate programs, and 6 associate degrees. The university was originally
            established on
            May 8th, 1964, from merging Ontario Agricultural College (OAC), the Ontario Veterinary College, and the
            Macdonald
            Institute. Later that year, Wellington College was also added to provide opportunities in arts and sciences.
            <br><br>I worked in the Office of Registrarial Services which is made up of a variety of departments which
            recruits
            and
            admits students, provides financial support, schedules courses and exams, and produces transcripts and
            diplomas. I
            worked in the technological department where I was tasked with a variety of technical jobs which allowed me
            to
            gain
            hands on learning experiences and further develop my abilities.
        </p>

    <div id="Goals" class="page">
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>I created a variety of goals at the beginning of my work term that I aimed to achieve before completing my
            internship with the university.</p>
        <p>As a computer science major, I am always looking to improve
            and learn about technology. As technology is constantly
            changing, one of my goals was to improve my technological literacy by learning
            more about computer hardware and software and expanding my
            skill set. More specifically, I hoped to learn and use a new programming language or one that I didn't have
            as
            much experience with, to work on real world projects in the office. I was able to do so with Visual Basic
            and SQL.
            I was tasked with reviewing and updating code which challenged my debugging skills and ability to understand
            code
            that was previously written. This can be benefital for future work experience as I gained hands on
            experience
            working with Visual Basic and SQL and continued to develop my problem solving skills and ability to
            critically
            think.

    <div id="Description" class="page">
        <h5>Job Description</h5>
        <p>In this position, I had a variety of tasks ranging from hardware projects to software development to
            supporting
            technical documentation. This includes updating and maintaining a variety of technical documents for the
            university. During my work term I also
            edited and debugged Visual Basic and SQL code, or XML code for forms found on the university website. I also
            gained experience in excel, processing a variety of files which included applicants, transfer students and
            their
            information. I was responsible for setting up user accounts, managing security measures, and troubleshooting
            access issues. This role developed my communication skills within a work environment, my technical literacy,
            and
            my ability to meet deadlines.</p>
