  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Andrew Clare-Green, I am a 3rd year student majoring in Computer Science at the
    University of Guelph. This website will highlight my experience working for the University of Guelph in the
    Registrar Office as a Co-op student. This includes what I accomplished during this work term, as well as what I
    learned and reflection on my goals I created throughout my term.</p>
  <h2>About the Employer</h2>
  <p>Located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, the University of Guelph is home to nearly 30,000 students, offering 94
    undergraduate degrees, 48 graduate programs, and 6 associate degrees. The university was originally established on
    May 8th 1964 from merging Ontario Agricultural College (OAC), the Ontario Veterinary College, and the Macdonald
    Institute. Later that year, Wellington College was also added to provide opportunities in arts and sciences.</p>
  <p>I worked in the Office of Registrarial Services which is made up of a variety of departments which recruits and
    admits students, provides financial support, schedules courses and exams, and produces transcripts and diplomas. I
    worked in the technological department where I was tasked with a variety of technical jobs which allowed me to gain
    hands on learning experiences and further develop my abilities.</p>
